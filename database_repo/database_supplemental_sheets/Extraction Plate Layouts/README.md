# Extraction Plate Layouts:  

This subdirectory contains files with “plate layouts” for specific extractions. These are generally made if an extraction plate contains non-continues extractions (i.e. not from the same population or species). For example, if the plate contains two or more separate populations or species that will break the sample sequence.
